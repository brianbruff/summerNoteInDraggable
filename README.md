Summernote in Resizable Div
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Summernote is quite a nice control.
Setting the size is as easy as specifying a height, however if you want to have this in a resizable div you'll encounter problems if you wish to have the summernote fill the div.

The simpliest solution i could fine [after trying to css my way out of it] is to set the height of the control when the parent div resizes.
